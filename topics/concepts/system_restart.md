# System Restart

The System Restart section contains buttons for restarting the software and for rebooting the hardware.

-   The **Restart button** restarts the software only. It is a quick way to implement siftware changes.
-   The **Reboot button** reboots the Raspberry Pi. This takes longer but does a complete restart of the system.
