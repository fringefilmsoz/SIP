# About the Stations page

The Stations page is for naming stations and setting station specific options.

-   The **Name** field allows you to give the station a descriptive name. Named stations are especially helpful when creating scheduling programs.

-   The **Enabled?** check box controls if the station will appear on other pages. For example, if you have 6 station and you clear the boxes for stations 7 and 8, only 6 stations will appear on other pages. It does not affect the operation of the station.

-   The **Ignore Rain?** check box allows a station to continue to operate when a rain sensor is activated or a rain delay has been set. This is useful for stations that are not effected by rain such as plants in protected arias or station that control devices such as pumps or lights.

-   The **Ignore plugin adjustments?** check box prevents plugins from changing the scheduled run time of a station.

-   If a **master station** is enabled on the **Options** page **Activate master?** check boxes are added. When the station is turned on the master will also be turned on if the box is checked.
