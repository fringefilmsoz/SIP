# About Sequential and Concurrent modes

Sequential mode is the default mode of operation. Stations run one after another by station number. The only exception is the master station which runs at the same time as any station that is set to activate the master. This is the most common mode of operation for an irrigation controller.

Concurrent mode allows more than one station to run at the same time. This is useful when more than one master is required. For example when different pumps or valves must be activated to provide pressure to irrigation zones.

**Warning:** Running several stations in concurrent mode can draw excessive power and reduce water pressure so use with caution.
