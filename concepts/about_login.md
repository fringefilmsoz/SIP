# About the login page

The optional login page is disabled by default to make initial setup and use as easy a possible.

You can enable this page to add a password requirement by selecting the **Enable passphrase** check box on the **Options** page under **Manage Passphrase**.

The login page presents a text box for entering a password before other SIP pages are accessible. ![](./images/login_page.png)

**Note:**

The password provides only minimal security. It is indented to prevent unauthorized change to SIP settings.
