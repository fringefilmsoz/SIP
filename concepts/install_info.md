# Installing SIP

## What you will need:

-   Any model of Raspberry Pi that has Ethernet or WiFi support.

    **Note:**
    Considering that SIP is intended to be running 24/7 for years, a Raspberry Pi with a low power requirement is recommended. A model 3 B or 3 B+ is a good choice for easy set up.

-   A micro SD card with the latest Raspberry Pi OS installed. For a SIP installation **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** with headless access is recommended. See **Installing Raspberry Pi OS for SIP**.
-   A high-quality 2.5A micro USB power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
-   An Internet connection.

## Installation methods

There are two ways SIP can be installed:  
-   Using a script that automates the process.
-   By entering commands in a step-by-step procedure.
