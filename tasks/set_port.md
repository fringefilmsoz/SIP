# HTTP port

The HTTP port number is part of the system's URL. Port 80 is the default number for web pages.

1.  Click in the text field next to the HTTP port option.
2.  Type the port number you wish to use, e.g. 8080.
3.  Click the **Commit Changes** button at the bottom of the page.

You will be returned to the home page.

The system will reboot but there is no visible indication of the reboot in the web interface. Wait at least 60 seconds, then add the new port number to the URL of the Pi, preceded by a colon \(:\), and try re-connecting to SIP.
