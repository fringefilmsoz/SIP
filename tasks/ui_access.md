# Opening the SIP web interface

SIP uses Internet technology to provide a User Interface (UI) in the form of a local self hosted web site. You can access the web interface from most devices with a browser such as a laptop, tablet, or phone.  
With the Pi booted up and SIP running use one of the steps below to open the UI .

**Note:**
If the default HTTP port 80 has been changed, you will need to add a colon (**:**) followed by the new port number to the address shown below.

-   Enter the Pi's hostname followed by **.local** into your browser's address bar

    replace **[hostname]** with the Pi's hostname.

    <pre>[hostname].local</pre>  
    For example: sip-system.local

    The home page of SIP's interface will appear in your browser.

-   Enter the Pi's IP address.

    <pre>192.168.1.123</pre>

    **Note:** The IP address of your Pi will be different

    **Tip:**
    You can find the Pi's IP address by using the command line. See step 4 of **SSH Access**.

    The home page of SIP's interface will appear in your browser.
