# Set System name

Naming the system is useful when working with several controllers.

1.  Enter a unique descriptive name for the system.
2.  Click the **Submit Changes** button at the bottom of the page to save the change.

When the system name has been changed from SIP, the default, it will be displayed in the header of each page for easy system identification.
