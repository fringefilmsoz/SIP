# Logging in with a passphrase

Logging in to SIP with a passphrase can help protect your SIP settings from accidental or unauthorized changes.

1.  Navigate to the **OPTIONS** page and open the **Manage Passphrase** section,

2.  Select the **Enable passphrase** check box.

3.  Click ![](../images/submit_changes.png) at the bottom of the page.

    ![](../images/logout_btn.png) has now been added to the navigation bar at the top of the page.

4.  Click the logout button to exit SIP.

    You will now be at the login screen and your passphrase will be required to access SIP.

5.  Enter the passphrase and click ![](../images/login.png) to enter SIP's main user interface.

    The default passphrase is **opendoor**.

    Wen you log in with a passphrase you begin a session. If you close SIP's browser tab without logging out, you can re-open SIP with the same browser without the passphrase. Logging out will end the session.
