# Logging in with a passphrase

Logging in to SIP with a passphrase can help protect your SIP settings from accidental or unauthorized changes.

1.  Navigate to the **OPTIONS** page and open the **Manage Passphrase** section,

2.  Select the **Enable passphrase** check box.

3.  Click ![](./images/submit_button.png) at the bottom of the page.

    ![](./images/logout_btn.png) has now been added to the navigation bar at the top of the page.

4.  Click the logout button to exit SIP.

    You will now be at the login screen and your passphrase will be required to access SIP.

5.  Enter the passphrase and click ![](./images/login.png) to enter SIP's main user interface.

    The default passphrase is **opendoor**.

    When you log in with a passphrase you begin a session. The session remains active as long as sip is open in the browser.

    If you close SIP's browser tab without logging out, you can re-open SIP with the same browser without the passphrase for a period of 24 hours. After 24 hours the session will expire and you will need to use your passphrase to log in again.
